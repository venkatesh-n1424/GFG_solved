### 📜 Problem Description

You are given an array of integers  `nums` , there is a sliding window of size  `k`  which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the  `k`  numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return  *the max sliding window* .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]

```

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
	
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
	
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
