### 📜 Problem Description

Given two integers  **x**  and  **y**  representing the GCD and LCM of two unknown positive integers  **a**  and  **b** , count the number of valid pairs  **(a, b)**  satisfying these conditions. Note that  **(a, b)** and  **(b, a)**  are counted as distinct pairs when  **a ≠ b** .

**Examples:**

```
Input: x = 2, y = 12
Output: 4
Explanation: The valid pairs are (2, 12), (4, 6), (6, 4), and (12, 2), since each pair has GCD = 2 and LCM = 12.
```

```
Input: x = 6, y = 4
Output: 0
Explanation: LCM must always be a multiple of GCD. Since y is not divisible by x, no valid pair exists.
```

**Constraints:** 
1 ≤ x, y ≤ 104
