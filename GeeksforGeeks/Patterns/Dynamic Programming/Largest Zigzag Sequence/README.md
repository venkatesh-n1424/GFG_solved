### 📜 Problem Description

Given a square matrix  **mat[][]**  of size  **n × n** . A zigzag sequence starts from the top and ends at the bottom. Two consecutive elements of sequence cannot belong to the same column.

Return the maximum sum of such a zigzag sequence.

**Examples:**

```
Input: mat[][] = [[3, 1, 2], [4, 8, 5], [6, 9, 7]]
Output: 18
Explanation:

One optimal zigzag sequence is: 3 -> 8 -> 7, where the sum = 3 + 8 + 7 = 18.

```

```
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 2, 4], [3, 9, 6], [11, 3, 15]]
Output: 28
Explanation:

One optimal zigzag sequence is: 4 -> 9 -> 15, where the sum = 4 + 9 + 15 = 28.
```

**Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ 100
1 ≤ mat[i][j] ≤ 1000
