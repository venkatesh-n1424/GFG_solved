### 📜 Problem Description

Given three arrays  **height[]** ,  **width[]** , and  **length[]**  of size n, where height[i], width[i], and length[i] represent the dimensions of the ith box, find the maximum possible height of a stack formed using these boxes.

- A box can be rotated so that any of its dimensions becomes its height.

- A box can be placed on top of another only if both dimensions of its base are strictly smaller than those of the box below.

- Multiple instances of the same box can be used.

**Examples:**

```
Input: height[] = [4, 1, 4, 10], width[] = [6, 2, 5, 12], length[] = [7, 3, 6, 32]
Output: 60
Explanation: One possible arrangement of the boxes from bottom to top is shown below. Note that there can be multiple instances of a box type.
 
Hence, the total height of this stack is 10 + 32 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 3 = 60. No other combination of boxes produces a height greater than this.

```

```
Input: height[] = [1, 4, 3], width[] = [2, 5, 4], length[] = [3, 6, 1]
Output: 15
Explanation: One possible arrangement of the boxes from bottom to top is shown below: 

Hence, the total height of this stack is 4 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 15 No other combination of boxes produces a height greater than this.
