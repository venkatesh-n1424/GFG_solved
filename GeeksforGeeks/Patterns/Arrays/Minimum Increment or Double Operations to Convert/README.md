### 📜 Problem Description

Given an array  **arr[]** . Initially, you have another array containing only 0s.
In one operation, you may either:

- Choose any one element and increase its value by 1, or

- Double the values of all elements in the array simultaneously.

Find the minimum **** number of operations required to transform the initial all-zero array into the given array arr[].

**Examples:**

```
Input: arr[] = [16, 16, 16]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
First, increase each element to make the array [1, 1, 1] (3 steps).
Then, multiply the whole array by 2 four times:
[1,1,1] -> [2,2,2] -> [4,4,4] -> [8,8,8] -> [16,16,16]
Total steps = 3 + 4 = 7.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 3]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Start from [0, 0].
Increase both elements to get [1, 1] (2 steps)
Multiply once: [2, 2] (1 step)
Increase second element once: [2, 3] (1 step)
Total steps = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.
```

**Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 109
