### 📜 Problem Description

Given a binary matrix  **mat[][]**  of size  **n × m** , where each cell contains either  **0**  or  **1** , find the total perimeter of all figures formed by cells containing  **1s** . Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a common side.

A single cell containing 1 has a perimeter of 4, whereas two adjacent cells containing 1 (i.e., 11) together have a perimeter of 6.

**Examples :**

```
Input: mat[][] = [[0,1,0,0,0], [1,1,1,0,0], [1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 12
Explanation: The five cells form a single figure. Hence, the perimeter of the figure is 12.     

```

```
Input: mat[][] = [[1,0], [1,1]]
Output: 8
Explanation: The two adjacent cells share one common side. Hence, the perimeter of the figure is 6.
