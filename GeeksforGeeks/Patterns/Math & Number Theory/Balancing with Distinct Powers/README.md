### 📜 Problem Description

Given a simple weighing scale with two pans, a target weight  **b** , and a set of weights where each weight is a distinct power of  **a** , find if the scale can be balanced such that:

b + (some powers of a) = (some other powers of a)

**Note:**  Exactly one weight is available for each power of a, so each power can be used at most once.

**Examples:**

```
Input: a = 4, b = 11
Output: true
Explanation: 11 + 4 + 1 = 16. So, target = 11 can be balanced using powers of 4.
```

```
Input: a = 3, b = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 5 + 3 + 1 = 9. So, target = 5 can be balanced using powers of 3.
