### 📜 Problem Description

Given an integer  **n** , count the number of binary strings of length 2 * n that contain exactly n ones and n zeros such that every prefix of the string contains at least as many ones as zeros. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

**Examples:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: "1100", "1010" are two such strings of size 4 which have exactly two 1's in each.
```

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: "111000", "101100", "101010", "110010", "110100" are such 5 strings which have exactly three 1's in each.
```
