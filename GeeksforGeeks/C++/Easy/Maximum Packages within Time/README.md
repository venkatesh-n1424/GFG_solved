### 📜 Problem Description

A delivery agent has to deliver packages at locations arranged in a line. The number of packages at the **ith**  location is given by  **arr[i]** .

- The agent can start at any location and can only visit consecutive locations.
- Visiting each location takes 1 unit of time.

Given  **arr[]**  and  **totalTime** , find the maximum number of packages the agent can deliver within  **totalTime** .

**Examples:**

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 5, 0, 1, 4], totalTime = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: The agent can visit three consecutive locations. Starting from the second location, it delivers arr[1] + arr[2] + arr[3] = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 packages.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [1, 6, 2, 5, 3, 4], totalTime = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The agent can visit two consecutive locations. Starting from the second location, it delivers arr[1] + arr[2] = 6 + 2 = 8 packages. Starting from the fourth location gives arr[3] + arr[4] = 5 + 3 = 8 packages. Hence, the maximum is 8 packages.
