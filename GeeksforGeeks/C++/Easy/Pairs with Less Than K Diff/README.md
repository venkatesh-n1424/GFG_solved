### 📜 Problem Description

Given an array  **arr[]** of positive integers and an integer  **k** , find the total number of pairs of elements that have an absolute difference strictly less than **** k.

**Note:** Pair (i, j) is considered the same as (j, i).

**Examples:**

```
Input : arr[] = [1, 10, 4, 2], k = 3
Output : 2
Explanation: We have an array arr[] = [1, 10, 4, 2] and k = 3 We can make only two pairs with a difference of less than 3. (1, 2) and (4, 2). So, the answer is 2.

```

```
Input : arr[] = [2, 3, 4], k = 5
Output : 3
Explanation:  For the given array arr[] = [2, 3, 4] and k = 5, there are 3 valid pairs where the absolute difference between the pair's elements is less than 5. These pairs are (2, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 4). Hence, the output is 3.

```

**Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ k ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105
