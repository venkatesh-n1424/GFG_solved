### 📜 Problem Description

Given an array **arr[]** of integers and a range  **[l, r]** , count the number of subsets whose Minimum Excluded (MEX) value lies within the given range, inclusive.

- Minimum Excluded (or  **MEX** ) of a subset is the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the subset.
- An empty subset has Minimum Excluded as zero.

Since the answer can be very large, return the answer modulo  **109 + 7** .

**Examples:**

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 0, 1, 0], l = 1, r = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: The subsets whose MEX lies in the range [1, 2] are counted as follows:
MEX = 1: The subsets must contain at least one 0 and must not contain 1. These subsets are [0] (2 ways), [2, 0] (2 ways), [0, 0] (1 way), and [2, 0, 0] (1 way). Total = 6.
MEX = 2: The subsets must contain both 0 and 1 but must not contain 2. These subsets are [0, 1] (2 ways) and [0, 1, 0] (1 way). Total = 3.
The subsets [2, 0, 1] and [2, 0, 1, 0] have MEX = 3, which is outside the given range. Therefore, the total number of valid subsets is 6 + 3 = 9.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [2, 0, 1], l = 1, r = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The subsets whose MEX lies in the range [1, 2] are [0] (MEX = 1), [2, 0] (MEX = 1), and [0, 1] (MEX = 2). Hence, the answer is 3.
