### 📜 Problem Description

Given an integer array  **arr[]**  and two integers  **l**  and  **r** , find the number of subarrays whose sum lies in the range [l, r] (inclusive).

A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within the array.

**Examples:**

```
Input: l = 3, r = 8, arr[] = [1, 4, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation: The subarrays are [1,4], [4] and [6]. Therefore answer for this test case is 3.

```

```
Input: l = 4, r = 13, arr[] = [2, 3, 5, 8]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subarrays are [2, 3], [2, 3, 5], [3, 5], [5], [5, 8] and [8]. 
Therefore answer for this test case is 6.

```

**Constraints:** 
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104
1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 109
