### 📜 Problem Description

Given root of a binary tree and the values of its two nodes  **p**  and  **q** , count turns required to travel from node p to q.

- A turn occurs whenever the direction of movement changes from left to right or right to left while traversing the tree.

- If the path between the two nodes does not involve any turns (i.e., the nodes lie on the same straight path), return  **-1** .

**Note:** All node values are distinct.

**Examples :**

```
Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, N, N, N, 9, 10], p = 5, q = 10

Output: 4
Explanation: The path from node 5 to node 10 is: 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 6 → 10. Direction changes occur at nodes 2, 1, 3, and 6. Therefore, the number of turns is 4.

```

```
Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, N, N, N, 9, 10], p = 1, q = 4

Output: -1
Explanation: No turn is required since they are in a straight line.
```

**Constraints:** 
1 ≤ n ≤ 104, n is the number of nodes
1 ≤ node->data ≤ 104
1 ≤ p, q ≤ n
