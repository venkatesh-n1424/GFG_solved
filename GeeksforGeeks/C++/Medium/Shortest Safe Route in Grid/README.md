### 📜 Problem Description

Given a 2D matrix  **mat[][]**  of size  **n**  ×  **m** , where each cell is either 0 (landmine) or 1 (safe), find the minimum number of steps required to travel from any cell in the leftmost column to any cell in the rightmost column.

- You can move only in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- A cell is unsafe if it contains a landmine or is directly adjacent (up, down, left, or right) to a landmine, and such cells must be avoided.
- Return -1 if no safe path exists.

**Examples:**

```
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]]

Output: 6
Explanation: We can see that length of shortest safe route is 6. 

```

```
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]

Output: -1
Explanation: There is no possible path from first column to last column.
