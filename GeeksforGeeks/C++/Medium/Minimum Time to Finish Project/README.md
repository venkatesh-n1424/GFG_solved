### 📜 Problem Description

An IT company is working on a large project consisting of  **n**  modules.

- The given array time required (in months) to complete the  **ith**  module is stored in the array  **duration[]** .
- The array  **dependencies[][]** , where dependencies[i] = [u, v], indicates that module v can be started only after module u is completed.

Multiple modules can be worked on simultaneously as long as all their dependencies have been completed.

Find the minimum time required to complete the entire project.

- If the project cannot be completed due to a cyclic dependency, return -1.
- A module is never dependent on itself.

**Examples**

```
Input: duration[] = [10, 20, 30, 10, 30, 20], dependencies[][] = [[5, 2], [5, 0], [4, 0], [4, 1], [2, 3], [3, 1]]
Output: 80
Explanation: 

The Graph of dependency forms this and the project will be completed when Module 1 is completed. The minimum taken time is 80 months, the maximum taken time is through the path 5 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 which takes 20 + 30 + 10 + 20
```

```
Input: duration[] = [5, 5, 5], dependencies[][] = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the dependency graph hence the project cannot be completed.
