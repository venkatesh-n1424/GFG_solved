### 📜 Problem Description

Given a square chessboard of size  **n × n** , the initial position  **knightPos**  and target position  **targetPos**  of a Knight are given. Find the minimum number of moves required for the Knight to reach targetPos.

A Knight moves in an L-shape, covering 2 cells in one direction and 1 cell perpendicular to it. From (x, y), it can move to: (x ± 2, y ± 1) and (x ± 1, y ± 2)

This gives at most 8 possible moves:

 **Note:**  The positions are given using 1-based indexing.

**Examples:**

```
Input: n = 3, knightPos[] = [3, 3], targetPos[]= [1, 2]
Output: 1
Explanation: Knight takes 1 step to reach from (3, 3) to (1 ,2).
```

```
Input: n = 6, knightPos[] = [1, 3], targetPos[] = [5, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: In above diagram Knight takes 2 step to reach from (1, 3) to (5, 0): (1, 3) -> (3, 2) -> (5, 1)
