### 📜 Problem Description

Given a binary matrix  **mat[][]**  of size n*m and an integer  **k** , process a list of queries  **queries[][]** . Each query contains coordinates [i, j] of the center of a square.

- For every query, find the side length of the largest odd-sized square centered at cell (i, j) such that the square contains at most k ones.

- A square centered at (i, j) expands outward symmetrically in all four directions by the same number of cells, so its side length is always odd.

**Note:**  If no odd-sized square centered at the given cell satisfies the condition of containing at most k ones, return -1 for that query.

**Examples:**

```
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 0, 1, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]], queries[][] = [[1, 2]], k = 9
Output: [3]
Explanation: The largest odd-sized square centered at (1, 2) is the 3 × 3 square spanning rows 0 to 2 and columns 1 to 3. 
It contains 6 ones, which is at most k = 9. Hence, the answer is 3.
```

```
Input: mat[][] = [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1]], queries[][] = [[1, 1], [2, 2]], K = 9
Output: [3, 1]
Explanation: For query (1, 1), the largest valid square is the entire 3 × 3 matrix, which contains 9 ones. Hence, the answer is 3.
For query (2, 2), no expansion is possible without going outside the matrix, so only the 1 × 1 square centered at (2, 2) is valid. Hence, the answer is 1.
```

**Constraints:** 1 ≤ mat.size(), mat[0].size() ≤ 500
1 ≤ queries.size() ≤ 104
0 ≤ queries[q][0] < mat.size()
0 ≤ queries[q][1] < mat[0].size()
0 ≤ k ≤ mat.size() * mat[0].size()
