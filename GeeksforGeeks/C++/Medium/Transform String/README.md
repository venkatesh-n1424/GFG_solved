### 📜 Problem Description

Given two strings  **s1**  and  **s2** . Find the minimum number of steps required to transform string s1 into string s2. The only allowed operation for the transformation is selecting a character from string s1 and inserting it in the beginning of string s1.

If transformation is not possible return  **-1** .

**Examples:**

```
Input: s1 = "abd", s2 = "bad"
Output: 1
Explanation: The conversion can take place in 1 operation: Pick 'b' and place it at the front.
```

```
Input: s1 = "GeeksForGeeks", s2 = "ForGeeksGeeks"
Output: 3
Explanation: The conversion can take place in 3 operations: 
Pick 'r' and place it at the front.
s1 = "rGeeksFoGeeks"
Pick 'o' and place it at the front.
s1 = "orGeeksFGeeks"
Pick 'F' and place it at the front.
s1 = "ForGeeksGeeks"
```

**Constraints:**
